This provides a simple installer for Aeneas for Mac OS X 10.7 and up.  
_Work is being done to provide similar for MS Windows 7 and up._

To build this installer for Mac OS X first download or clone this repository.  
Then run build_setup.sh which will install Aeneas and its necessary dependencies.  
Finally run build_packages.sh which will install the necessary applications needed for building and then build the packages.
