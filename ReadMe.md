This provides a simple installer for [Aeneas](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas) for Mac OS X 10.7 and up.  
_Work is being done to provide similar for MS Windows 7 and up._

1. To build this installer for Mac OS X first download or clone this repository.  
2. Then run build_setup.sh which will install Aeneas and its necessary dependencies and install the necessary applications needed for building.  
3. Finally run build_packages.sh which will then build the packages.
